# Predicting Infected Malaria Cells Using Convolution Neural Network.

Build a Convolution Neural Network   model to predict whether a cell is infected from malaria or not.
The image dataset of the cells was sourced from NIH (National Institute of Health) website. Since we had limited data of about 27,000 images to train the model, we used Image Manipulation technique to manipulate the images with rotation, resizing, and scaling so the model becomes more robust to different images that our data set doesn't have.
Our model was able to achieve 95% precision and 94% recall with f1-score of 95%.

Please Follow the code on the Jupyter Notebook for complete understanding.
